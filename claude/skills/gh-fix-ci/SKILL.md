# Gh Pr Checks Plan Fix

## Overview

Use gh to locate failing PR checks, fetch GitHub Actions logs for actionable failures, summarize the failure snippet, then propose a fix plan and implement after explicit approval.
- If a plan-oriented skill (for example `create-plan`) is available, use it; otherwise draft a concise plan inline and request approval before implementing.

Prereq: authenticate with the standard GitHub CLI once (for example, run `gh auth login`), then confirm with `gh auth status` (repo + workflow scopes are typically required).

## Inputs

- `repo`: path inside the repo (default `.`)
- `pr`: PR number or URL (optional; defaults to current branch PR)
- `gh` authentication for the repo host

## Quick start

- `python3 "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "<number-or-url>"`
- Add `--json` if you want machine-friendly output for summarization.

## Workflow

1. Verify gh authentication.
   - Run `gh auth status` in the repo.
   - If unauthenticated, ask the user to run `gh auth login` (ensuring repo + workflow scopes) before proceeding.
2. Resolve the PR.
   - Prefer `mergify stack list --json` to get the PR number from the current stack.
   - Fallback to `gh pr view --json number,url` if `mergify` CLI is unavailable.
   - If the user provides a PR number or URL, use that directly.
3. Inspect failing checks (GitHub Actions only).
   - Preferred: run the bundled script (handles gh field drift and job-log fallbacks):
     - `python3 "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "<number-or-url>"`
     - Add `--json` for machine-friendly output.
   - Manual fallback:
     - `gh pr checks <pr> --json name,state,bucket,link,startedAt,completedAt,workflow`
       - If a field is rejected, rerun with the available fields reported by `gh`.
     - For each failing check, extract the run id from `detailsUrl` and run:
       - `gh run view <run_id> --json name,workflowName,conclusion,status,url,event,headBranch,headSha`
       - `gh run view <run_id> --log`
     - If the run log says it is still in progress, fetch job logs directly:
       - `gh api "/repos/<owner>/<repo>/actions/jobs/<job_id>/logs" > "<path>"`
4. Scope non-GitHub Actions checks.
   - If `detailsUrl` is not a GitHub Actions run, label it as external and only report the URL.
   - Do not attempt Buildkite or other providers; keep the workflow lean.
5. Summarize failures for the user.
   - Provide the failing check name, run URL (if any), and a concise log snippet.
   - Call out missing logs explicitly.
6. Create a plan.
   - Use the `create-plan` skill to draft a concise plan and request approval.
7. Implement after approval.
   - Apply the approved plan, summarize diffs/tests.
8. Commit fixes into the correct stack commit and push.
   - When working with a stack of commits (`mergify stack list`), fixes must go into the commit that is associated with the PR being fixed, not just HEAD.
   - Run `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` to list all commits in the stack.
   - For each changed file, determine which commit introduced/modified it using `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD -- <file>`. If a file was not introduced by any stack commit (it's a pre-existing file), associate it with the PR commit whose tests expose the issue.
   - Group changed files by their target commit.
   - For each target commit, stage the relevant files and create a fixup commit:
     ```bash
     git add <files-for-this-commit>
     git commit --fixup=<target-sha>
     ```
   - Autosquash all fixup commits into their targets:
     ```bash
     GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=: git rebase --autosquash origin/main
     ```
   - Run `git check` (required before pushing), then push with `mergify stack push`.
   - **Shortcut:** If all fixes target HEAD, simply `git commit --amend --no-edit` instead.
9. Recheck status.
   - After changes, suggest re-running the relevant tests and `gh pr checks` to confirm.

## Bundled Resources

### scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py

Fetch failing PR checks, pull GitHub Actions logs, and extract a failure snippet. Exits non-zero when failures remain so it can be used in automation.

Usage examples:
- `python3 "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "123"`
- `python3 "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --pr "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123" --json`
- `python3 "<path-to-skill>/scripts/inspect_pr_checks.py" --repo "." --max-lines 200 --context 40`
